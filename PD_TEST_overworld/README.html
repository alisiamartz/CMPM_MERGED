        	Step 1: Open up an email for a mission.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Step 2: Look up suspect in database for case number.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Step 3: Initialize Hack then type in case number.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Step 4: Don't run out of time
        </p>
        <p>
        	Step 5: The hack requires you to disable the target. You have multiple commands that you can execute.<br>
        	ATTACK - attack<br>
        	ATTACKUP - brings up your attack<br>
        	ATTACKDOWN - brings down enemy attack<br>
        	<br><br>
        	DEFUP - brings up you defense<br>
        	DEFDOWN - brings down enemy defense <br>
        	<br><br>
        	SECDOWN - brings down enemy security<br>
        	MASKUP - brings up your security (mask)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Step 6: Each hack has a special extra way to win depending on the mission type. They are:
        </p>
        <p>
        	Get Dirt: Use the SEARCH command, then use the DOWNLOAD command, then continue entering normal commands until download is false.
        	Repeat until successful.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Upload: Similar to Get Dirt, except, unlike SEARCH, the SETUP command must be entered repeatedly until SetUp is true.
        	After that, use the SEND command, then continue entering normal commands until successful.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Data Operation: Similar to Get Dirt, except there are multiple processes that only require one of three commands.
        	Those commands are ADD, DELETE, and FIND. Success is a random amount of turns after all special numbers are zero or less.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Step 7: Work ends at 5:00 PM (17:00)
