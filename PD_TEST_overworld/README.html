			Welcome to your job as a DRA NSS Hacker. <br>
        	Step 1: Open up an email for a mission.<br>
<br>
        	Step 2: Look up suspect in database for case number.
<br>
        	Step 3: Initialize Hack then type in case number.
<br>
        	Step 4: Don't run out of time
<br>
        	Step 5: The hack requires you to disable the target. You have multiple commands that you can execute.<br>
        	ATTACK - attack<br>
        	ATTACKUP - brings up your attack<br>
        	ATTACKDOWN - brings down enemy attack<br>
        	<br><br>
        	DEFUP - brings up you defense<br>
        	DEFDOWN - brings down enemy defense <br>
        	<br><br>
        	SECDOWN - brings down enemy security<br>
        	MASKUP - brings up your security (mask)<br>

        	Step 6: Each hack has a special extra way to win depending on the mission type. They are:
<br>
        	Get Dirt: Use the SEARCH command, then use the DOWNLOAD command, then continue entering normal commands until download is false.<br>
        	Repeat until successful.<br>
<br>
        	Upload: Similar to Get Dirt, except the SETUP command must be entered repeatedly until SetUp is true.<br>
        	After that, use the SEND command, then continue entering normal commands until successful.<br>

        	Data Operation: Similar to Get Dirt, except there are multiple processes that only require one of three commands.
        	<br>Those commands are ADD, DELETE, and FIND. Success is a random amount of turns after all special numbers are zero or less.
<br><br>
        	Step 7: Work ends at 5:00 PM (17:00)
